a simple assistant used to do simple tasks

This is made by Dps Bulandshahr(Ansh Bhardwaj , Adit Kumar and Yash Vardan)

to operate this...
you first have to say "wake" or "bye"(like you can also say a sentence like, "i am  going now , bye" but the keyword "bye" should be there in that sentence)

secondly, when you use speech to text... it will copy your speech's text and then you can past it anywhere you want

as we made this program in  like 2 days.... its not possible to add so many features without bugs and some condition based error... and you should have active internet connection for this

in some days we are going to add some more features in it but you can review our program on this email-"ansh.bhardwaj457@gmail.com" or "ansh.bhardwaj457@outlook.com" 

or you can simply join our group on telegram---"https://t.me/+2KCQWKRHiwZhMWI1"

send your ideas to improve our assistant
and send info about bugs and errors you get in this

I will also develope a website for this to make this available to all in one click and you can aslo get infos and updates there(on telegram too)
